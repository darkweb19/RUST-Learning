# Rust Guessing Game

This repository contains a simple guessing game written in Rust. The purpose of this project is to help you learn and practice Rust programming.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and learning purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have Rust installed on your machine. If you don't have Rust installed, follow these steps to install it:

1. Visit the official [Rust installation page](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Follow the instructions to install Rust using `rustup`.
3. After installation, verify that Rust is installed correctly by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    rustc --version
    ```

    This should display the version of Rust that is installed.

### Cloning the Repository

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/rust-guessing-game.git
    ```

    Replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username.

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd rust-guessing-game
    ```

### Running the Guessing Game

1. To run the game, you need to build and execute the Rust program. Use the following command to compile and run the game:

    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```

    This command will compile the Rust code and start the guessing game. Follow the on-screen instructions to play.

### How to Play

-   The game will prompt you to guess a number between 1 and 100.
-   You have 10 tries to guess the correct number.
-   After each guess, you will receive feedback indicating whether your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
-   If you guess the correct number, you win! If you use up all 10 tries, the game will end, and you'll be informed that you've lost.
